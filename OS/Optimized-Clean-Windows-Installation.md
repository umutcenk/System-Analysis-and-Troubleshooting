Optimized OS Installation Strategy (Hierarchical Setup)
​Domain: System Architecture & Data Integrity
Objective: To establish a systematic, hierarchy-based protocol for clean Operating System (OS) installation to maximize performance and prevent driver conflict, ensuring high long-term stability.
​The Two-Phase Stability Protocol
When installing a new OS, simply installing drivers randomly is a major cause of future system bottlenecks. A structured, two-phase protocol is essential.
​Phase I: Installation and Isolation (Ensuring a Clean Base)
Test: The OS is installed without any active network connection (wired or Wi-Fi).
Logic: This critical step prevents the OS from automatically downloading generic or incompatible drivers, ensuring the initial environment is completely clean. This process demonstrates a control-oriented, "Isolation" approach to system administration.
​Phase II: Hierarchical Prioritization and Installation
Test: Drivers are installed manually in a specific, critical order.
Logic: The order of driver installation must follow the hardware hierarchy:
​1st Priority (Foundation): Chipset Drivers (These govern communication between the CPU and all other components).
​2nd Priority (Core Functionality): Network and Storage (SSD/HDD) Drivers.
​3rd Priority (Peripherals): Audio, GPU, and other external device drivers.
This "Hierarchical Prioritization" ensures the system's core functionality is established correctly before peripherals are introduced, guaranteeing maximum compatibility and stability.
​Conclusion
This structured installation strategy demonstrates a key skill for Informatics Engineering: approaching a complex setup not as a simple task, but as a system architecture problem requiring strict sequence control and adherence to component hierarchy.
