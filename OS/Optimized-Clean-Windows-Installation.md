Structured Guide for Optimized and Clean Windows Installation
​Domain: Operating System (OS) Management
Objective: To ensure the system utilizes hardware resources most efficiently by performing a Windows installation free of unnecessary software and residual driver conflicts.
​Analysis and Planning Phase (Targeting Zero Errors)
​Hardware Inventory: A list of all critical hardware components (Motherboard model, GPU, etc.) is compiled.
​Driver Pre-staging: To prevent Windows Update from installing faulty or outdated drivers post-installation, the most stable versions of critical components (Chipset, Network Card, GPU) are downloaded from the manufacturer's official site and staged on external storage.
​Partitioning Strategy: During installation, the SSD/HDD is completely wiped to perform a "clean" partitioning, mitigating the risk of slowdowns caused by old file tables.
​Implementation Steps
​Installation Media: Windows ISO media is prepared ensuring compatibility with GPT and UEFI standards.
​Offline Installation: The internet connection is disabled. (This prevents Windows from automatically installing drivers during setup.)
​Driver Priority: After the OS installation is complete, driver installation is executed in the following critical sequence:
​a) Chipset Driver (Highest priority)
​b) Network Drivers (To enable internet connectivity)
​c) GPU Driver
​d) Other Components
​Verification and Testing: The Device Manager is checked to confirm that no warning signs (!) remain, indicating a stable and conflict-free installation.
​Conclusion
​This disciplined approach validates system stability by focusing on infrastructure management skills rather than just performing a casual "setup."
